**I hate chess.** I have since I was a kid and first saw parents and grandparents sitting in silence, frowning over a board that I wanted to use to play checkers. It seemed like a terribly boring game and you couldn't even double jump. Once I was slightly older and could be convinced to sit still for more than two minutes at a time, an older friend sat be down and taught me what each piece could do.

All of this made sense and armed with that knowledge, I challenged her to a game. 

I promptly lost, having, I presume, based on my current tactics, abandonded all defense of my king and rushed across the board on the offensive. To say I was a sore loser would have been kind. But more than upset, I was confused. I knew all the rules, I understood how to move the pieces, but even that wasn't enough.
