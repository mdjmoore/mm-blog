The main goal of this post is to give you a short intro about myself. It should serve as an informal catch-up with those of you who don't know me that well yet üôÇ.

Hopefully, this will give you a better understanding of the content I am going to put out and the ideas I am going to express.

## The present in a¬†nutshell

I am a _27 year_ old Canadian based in Toronto_,_ **Ontario**.

Currently, I work at [**Uberflip**](https://www.uberflip.com), a SaaS company building a content experience platform for B2B and B2C businesses.

My main responsibility at Uberflip is developing our platform, using my skills as a fullstack developer to make the platform a joy to use. Currently I'm building in **React, GraphQL, SQL, TypeScript and PHP**, but have proficiency in **HTML, CSS and preprocessed CSS languages, Web Accessibility and jQuery.**

I'm currently working remotely and even though I'm an out-going person, I've found that I like the freedom and flexibility offered by remote work. 

## What about my free¬†time?

I have an energetic, playful and sometime vocal puppy named Innis (like the beer), so if I'm not at my desk, I'm taking him for a walk or playing fetch with him. Or teaching him to do some kind of silly trick. He mostly watches me work, his favourite spot during the day is to sit on the chair beside me and rest his chin on the desk. 

When I'm not spoiling my dog, I'm reading or writing. I love fiction and fantasy with a soft spot for Neil Gaiman novels. Writing-wise, it's something I do for fun as I enjoyed English and Theatre a lot when I was younger. 

I love to travel and do so whenever possible. I was lucky enough to travel extensively growing up so I have a huge fondness and respect for other cultures. At the top of my list for my next trip is Japan. 

Outside of work I'm also an acitve athlete and volunteer with Toronto Roller Derby and can happily talk about roller debry for hours if given the opporutnity. I'm currently the Vice President of Operations and work closely with both our venue and practice space to ensure we have a roof over our heads during the season, and also coordinate the training program used by all new skaters within the league.

## Final thoughts

Want to know more about me? Don't be shy and reach out to me on any of the socials listed on the homepage. I am always up for interesting discussions!

Thanks for reading! üôè
